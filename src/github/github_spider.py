"""File containing the GitHub spider

This file contains the logic for crawling through the [GitHub website](https://github.com/).

This crawling is done by using the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for HTTP calls,
and the [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library for HTML parsing.

Only the data-points that the API endpoints cannot provide are spidered.
