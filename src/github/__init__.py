"""
GitHub is one of, if not the, most used online service for version control and collaboration.
It is a free and open source software project that is used by millions of developers to share their code and projects.
Due to this, the source-code for libraries/packages can almost always be found on GitHub.

This makes it a prime source for information about libraries/packages. Not to mention that it provides
many API endpoints for easy access to important information.
