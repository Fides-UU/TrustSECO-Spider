"""File containing the communication between the TrustSECO-Spider and the ClamAV virus scanner.

This file contains all the logic for
scanning a list of urls (that point to files).
The scanning is done using ClamAV which
is running in another Docker container.

    Typical usage:

    foo = ClamAVScanner()
    bar = foo.get_virus_ratio([url1, url2, url3])
